-Make updater better and move obvious with more options! SOLVED
	(Alert if new update, option for auto-update, notify when updated)
-Make start with windows actually work (Might solve later on)
	(Need admin rights)
-Make sure it doesn't crash SOLVED (I guess? Needs testing, a lot)
	(Seemingly from copying a lot of things)
-Clipboard history clears itself after changing language, why? SOLVED
-When SaveToFile location is empty, it stays empty for some reason, need logic! SOLVED
-Make a "generate new file every startup" option.
        (This would generate and assign a new text file to save the clipboard history)
-Prepare online functionality
        (Possibly even the LAN bit)
